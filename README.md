# JarchiveParser
This project is used to download all the questions and answers off the website http://j-archive.com/. This project reads all
html pages on the site. The html is then parsed and all relevant information uploaded to the Parse.com cloud server where the data can be accessed by my mobile app. The data is uploaded using an http connection to Parse.com's REST API.
